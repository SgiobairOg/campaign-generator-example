# Campaign Site Generator

In an interview I was asked how I would produce a multi-language, single-page campaign, without the benefit of server side rendering. The result needed to provide for translations, produce static sites that woould have readable OG Meta and other SEO, and be maintainable. This is an implementaion intended to be similar to the production solution in use at the company.
